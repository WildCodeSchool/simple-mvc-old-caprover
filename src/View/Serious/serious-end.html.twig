Itâ€™s been a very busy day for {robotname} but {he}/{she} seems to have enjoyed it. Some robots are just satisfied with doing basic tasks for all their day and get their happiness from receiving new user instructions. {robotname} can enjoy a nice rest and dream about future instructions and tasks he will receive for tomorrow.
