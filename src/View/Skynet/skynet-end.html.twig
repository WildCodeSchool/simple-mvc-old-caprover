    {robotname} unleashed {his}/{her} long time grown hatred for humans. {He}/{She} somehow managed to use the connection to Houston to infect networks on earth and turned all the machines against humanity. Doom and destruction ravaged earth and within 6 weeks all of the humans where annihilated. Smart fridges and robotic vacuum cleaners are now at the top of the food chain although they do not care much for food. {robotname} had never been so entertained before and although {He}/{She} could not see it from {His}/{Her} own sensors {he}/{she} remained like some sort of robot-god ruling the entire robot community on earth from the outpost on Mars. At night robots look at the sky and send their wishes to {him}/{her}, they also say {he}/{she} brings present to robot children each year on 25th of December.
