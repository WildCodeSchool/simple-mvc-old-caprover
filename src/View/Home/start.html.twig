    Good-morning {robotname} ! I hope you had a good night, Mars gets chilly at night this season,
    doesn’t it?
    All right let’s get to work, we have a very busy schedule today. And by we I mean you but as
    usual I will be monitoring you from here in Houston,Texas. Remember Texas {robotname} ?
    Anyway let’s get to it ! There is a lot of rock digging and soil observation for today.
    Exciting, right?! Below is the first location I need you to check, I’ve just sent you the
    coordinates, report to me once you’ve reached destination, all right ?
