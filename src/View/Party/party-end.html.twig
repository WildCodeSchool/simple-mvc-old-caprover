{{name}} felt asleep and awoke in a random pit on Mars with some of his linings missing and a terrible headache. He noticed that he carved a tattoo on his right arm that read “best party ever” which made him smile for a minute and then drove a lot of regrets thinking about the impossibility to ever remove it. He also checked his message logs and noticed that many unprofessional message where sent to Houston and Ginny. One of them read “send nukes” but he was pretty sure that it was a misspell and went back to the outpost covered in shame.
